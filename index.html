                <p><h3> My dream since I graduated college has been to move to the NorthWest to live in Seattle and close to the mountains. That is why I left my previous company of 12 years in mid 2017 and moved accross the country with my wife and my two dogs. I have been taking a self guided sabbatical which I have utilized to learn new skills in software engineering in order to automate mechanical engineering analysis.<br>

                In the midst of my adventure I discovered a passion for all things intgernet which drove me to pursue a certificate in web development. So many new toys to play with!<br>

                I am also taking a C/C++ class which I have found very rewarding. One of my hobbies includes playing with Arduino boards. I cannot wait to design a website to magically control them through the internet!
